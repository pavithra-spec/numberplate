# Number Plate Detection using OpenCV and EasyOCR

This project demonstrates a simple approach to detecting and recognizing vehicle number plates using OpenCV for object detection and EasyOCR for text recognition. It is implemented in Python and designed to run in a Google Colab environment.

## üì∏ Features

* Detects number plates using Haar Cascade classifiers.
* Recognizes text from number plates using EasyOCR.
* Highlights the detected number plates in the image.
* Annotates the recognized text on the image.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (if not using Google Colab) and install the following libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python easyocr
```

If you're using **Google Colab**, everything will work out of the box with the provided setup.

### Clone or Upload the Notebook

You can run this directly in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), or download and open the `.ipynb` file in your local Jupyter Notebook environment.

### Input Image

Upload an image named `NUMPLATE.jpeg` (or update the `image_path` in the script accordingly). Make sure the number plate is visible and clear.

## üìÑ Usage

Here's a basic overview of the code structure:

```python
def detect_number_plate(image_path):
    ...
```

* Reads an image from the path provided.
* Converts it to grayscale.
* Uses Haar Cascade to detect number plates.
* Applies EasyOCR to extract text.
* Draws bounding boxes and displays the result.

### Example

```python
image_path = 'NUMPLATE.jpeg'
detect_number_plate(image_path)
```

## üì¶ Files

* `number_plate_detection.ipynb` - Main notebook file.
* `NUMPLATE.jpeg` - Sample input image (to be provided by the user).
* `README.md` - Project documentation.

## ‚úÖ Output

* The script prints the detected number plate text.
* Displays the image with detected number plates and annotated text.

## üß† Technologies Used

* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) for image processing and detection
* [EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR) for Optical Character Recognition
* Python (3.x)
* Google Colab for execution and testing

## üõ†Ô∏è Notes

* Accuracy depends on the clarity and angle of the image.
* This is a basic implementation; further improvements can include using deep learning models like YOLO or SSD for more robust detection.
